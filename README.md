This project uses the GTZAN Music Genre Dataset to classify songs into different genres by experimenting with multiple deep learning models — AutoEncoder, CNN, LSTM, and Transformer — trained and evaluated separately.
Each model learns distinct representations of the audio features:

* AutoEncoder compresses and reconstructs features for unsupervised learning.
* CNN captures spatial and frequency patterns in spectrograms.
* LSTM models the temporal dynamics in musical sequences.
* Transformer leverages attention mechanisms to understand global dependencies in audio data.

The performance of each architecture is compared to identify the most effective approach for accurate and robust music genre classification.

## AutoEncoder:
